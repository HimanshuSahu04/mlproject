# 🎓 Automated Student Performance Prediction Pipeline

![Pipeline Banner](./notebook/banner.png)  
*An end-to-end machine learning system to predict student academic performance using a structured and automated pipeline.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Automated Student Performance Prediction Pipeline** is a complete Machine Learning project that processes student data, trains predictive models, and generates performance forecasts with minimal manual intervention.

This pipeline includes all stages of a production-ready ML system — from **data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and model export**, to **deployment-ready artifacts**.

✔️ Modular pipeline for scaling & reuse  
✔️ Automated data handling & transformation  
✔️ Multiple models supported  
✔️ Easily extensible for new datasets

## 🧠 Motivation

Predicting student performance helps educators and institutions:

- Spot struggling students early
- Allocate resources more effectively
- Personalize learning interventions
- Improve academic outcomes

This project automates that predictive process using real student data.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Automated ML Pipeline**: Breaks down workflows into reusable components (data ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Data Validation & Cleaning**: Handles missing values and categorical encoding.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trains with standard ML algorithms and reports key metrics (e.g., R², MSE). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Artifacts & Logging**: Stores outputs for reproducibility.
- **Ready for Deployment**: Compatible with web interfaces (Flask, Streamlit, etc.).
